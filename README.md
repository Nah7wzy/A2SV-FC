## Introduction

This is a Website for A2SV Football Tournament

## Folder structure

On the top level, there are two folders - "client" "server".

### Client

This is where all the frontend code is. it's setup on netlify to update on new commits to this folder. The main folder structure is from the create-react-app template so it's very basic. The only thing to note is that I've stored the data for the app inside utils/data.

The frontend is made with react-typescript, redux, and tailwindCSS.

### Server

There isn't much at the moment inside the "server" folder.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) version 14+

## Installation

Navigate to the client folder, open the terminal, and run

```bash
npm install
```

AFter everything is installed, run

```bash
npm run start
```
